This document is about how dbus work with different display server.

Fcitx will support multiple focus, the focus is defined by display server.
Several application would belong to a specific focus group.

We'd like to see 3 kinds of focus group.
1. Global one, means "unknown", those application are regular application and
ought to have normal focus, but just can't decide which display server it
belongs to.
2. Display server group. Applications in different display server does not
share same focus.
3. Independent focus, those will not be affected by any application nor affect
any other application and will usually keep is "focused" state, which is designed
to be used on "webserver-like" frontend, or fbterm, tty.

This raises a problem between XCB and DBus.

Current situation:
1. Application in X prefer to use dbus for communication.
2. There is no way to identify a display server (namely, by address).
3. Application want to tell im server which display server it's on.

Solution:
When fcitx starts on one X server, it do XSetSelectionOwner on root, the atom name be
_FCITX_SERVER, if client is running as a X client, it will use XFixes to watch the
selection owner. When create a IC via dbus, fcitx will return with a one time id
(not ic id), and the dbus client, send _FCITX_SERVER a client message for with both icid
and the unique id. Fcitx will recognize the id and verify if it's the id for ic.
